      Why does a book need to have a definitive path from start to end?
      Why not have several path navigating through a story. This is what WebNovel aims to do.
      By giving users the ability to create alternative chapters or brand new paths, its goal
      is to give the opportunity for anyone to collaborate on a novel.
